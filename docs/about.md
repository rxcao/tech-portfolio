I am Rachel Cao, and I am a Software Engineer at Box. 

I started my career in technical support with no background in computer science. After a few years in support, I joined the engineering organization at Box as an Associate Software Engineer to work on customer-reported issue investigation and triage, as well as build and improve tools to address chronic issues.

I value opportunities to continuously learn and deepen my understanding of the world, particularly around how technology impacts our society. Besides that, I seek to give back and better the communities I am a part of, as I am a first-generation college student with a low-income background from a refugee family. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my dog, catching up on shows, trying out new recipes, and playing video games.
